🚀 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Python (Pandas).

Verified data structure and column details.

Displayed initial data samples for understanding.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Performed descriptive statistics and data profiling.

Identified outliers, null values, and data distributions.

Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize key relationships such as:

Customer demographics vs. purchase trends

Region-wise sales performance

Product category insights

3. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values and inconsistent data formats.

Removed duplicates and corrected categorical inconsistencies.

Created new derived features for deeper analysis.

4. Database Integration

Loaded the cleaned dataset into SQL Server / PostgreSQL / MySQL.

Created tables and inserted data using SQLAlchemy or direct import.

Executed SQL queries for:

Customer segmentation

Revenue and trend analysis

Regional performance comparison

5. Dashboard Development (Power BI)

Connected Power BI to the SQL database.

Created interactive visual dashboards including:

Sales Overview

Customer Demographics

Top Products & Regions

Monthly Revenue Trends

Added filters, slicers, and KPIs for dynamic exploration.

6. Report & Presentation

Summarized insights and recommendations.

Designed a professional Gamma presentation (PPT) to showcase:

Business questions & objectives

Analytical process

Key findings & visualization highlights

Strategic recommendations

📈 Results & Insights

Identified key customer segments contributing to majority revenue.

Observed purchasing patterns influenced by age, gender, and region.

Highlighted underperforming regions and high-demand product categories.

Delivered a Power BI dashboard and Gamma presentation summarizing actionable insights for business growth.
